## Overview
The Clanbutton makes game matchmaking super easy.
Sometimes, you may be playing games such as [Call of Duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty) or [Rainbow Six Siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_Siege). These games automatically add you to a lobby with other random players. But there's a problem with this! The other players may not have a microphone or they may not speak your language. 

The Clanbutton fixes this by allowing you to search for a game and connect with other users who want to play the same game. You will be able to view their profiles and see where they are from, if they use a microphone and other information such as the games they play or the game they are currently playing. All of this information will be pulled from their [Steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)) account.

## Development Tools
The following tools were used during the development of the Clanbutton:
* **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and the [Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/)** NoSQL database was used for storing user account information, starting user authentication and creating notifications.
* **C# programming language and .NET.** Programmed in C# we were able to use Xamarin for Visual Studio and the .NET framework which was super powerful and had everything we needed to develop an Android or iOS application.
* **[Xamarin for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/)** allowed us to develop our Android application but also port it over to iOS should we ever decide to, avoiding too many complications and re-invention of the wheel.
* **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)** for our main IDE for this project.
